# Test Plan for Navigation and Task Persistence Fixes

## âœ… FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

### 1. Navigation Persistence Fix

- **Problem**: App always redirects to AI Tutor dashboard on refresh
- **Solution**: Added localStorage persistence for `activeTab` state in App.js
- **Implementation**:
  - On app load: Read last active tab from `localStorage.getItem("eduaid_activeTab")`
  - On tab change: Save current tab to `localStorage.setItem("eduaid_activeTab", activeTab)`

### 2. Task Persistence Enhancement

- **Problem**: Study Planner tasks disappear on refresh or navigation
- **Solution**: Enhanced localStorage persistence with immediate saves and better debugging
- **Implementation**:
  - Added comprehensive logging to track localStorage operations
  - Immediate localStorage save on task add/edit/delete (not just on useEffect)
  - Better error handling and debugging for localStorage operations
  - Added global debug function: `window.debugLocalStorage()`

## ðŸ§ª HOW TO TEST:

### Test Navigation Persistence:

1. Start the app (should default to AI Tutor)
2. Navigate to Study Planner
3. Refresh the page
4. âœ… **Expected**: Should stay on Study Planner page (not go back to AI Tutor)

### Test Task Persistence:

1. Go to Study Planner
2. Add a new task (e.g., title: "Test Task")
3. Refresh the page
4. âœ… **Expected**: Task should still be visible
5. Navigate to another dashboard (e.g., Analytics)
6. Navigate back to Study Planner
7. âœ… **Expected**: Task should still be visible
8. Delete the task
9. Refresh the page
10. âœ… **Expected**: Task should be gone (only disappear when deleted)

### Debug Commands:

Open browser console and run:

- `window.debugLocalStorage()` - Shows current localStorage state
- `localStorage.getItem("eduaid_activeTab")` - Shows current saved tab
- `localStorage.getItem("studyPlan")` - Shows saved tasks

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL DETAILS:

### Navigation Fix (App.js):

```javascript
// Initialize with saved tab or default to "chat"
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState(() => {
  const savedTab = localStorage.getItem("eduaid_activeTab");
  return savedTab || "chat";
});

// Save tab changes to localStorage
useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem("eduaid_activeTab", activeTab);
}, [activeTab]);
```

### Task Persistence Fix (ModernStudyPlanner.js):

```javascript
// Immediate save on task operations
const addNewTask = (taskData) => {
  // ... create task
  setStudyPlan((prev) => {
    const updatedPlan = [...prev, newTask];
    // Immediately save to localStorage
    localStorage.setItem("studyPlan", JSON.stringify(updatedPlan));
    return updatedPlan;
  });
};
```

### Enhanced Logging:

- All localStorage operations now have detailed console logs
- Loading process shows what data is found/loaded
- Save operations confirm successful storage
- Error handling shows if localStorage fails

## ðŸš€ READY TO TEST!

Both fixes are now implemented. The app should:

1. âœ… Remember which page you were on after refresh
2. âœ… Keep Study Planner tasks persistent across refreshes and navigation
3. âœ… Only remove tasks when you explicitly delete them
4. âœ… Provide detailed console logging for debugging
